### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Terrence, an aspiring full-stack developer and a hopeful foodie who wants to try all the best food in the world! :poultry_leg:

Currently part of FAC20, the 20th cohort from the fantastic Founders and Coders coding bootcamp.

### Life before FAC
Before FAC, I worked at a contract research organisatioon which specialised in providing phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials to sponsors all over the world.

I was in the validation team which focused on documenting and testing all our computerised systems and equipment across all our departments such as the ward, the pharmacy and the laboratory departments. 

This was to ensure that all our systems were compliant with the strict regulations found in the clinical trials industry to ensure patient safety, product quality and data integrity. 

During my time in the department, I stumbled across an article written by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) that talked about how there is a push on using digital techonology to enhance the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.

This brought to my attention of how technology could be used within the pharmaceutical and healthcare spaces to improve productivity to ultimately better support and aid healthcare workers. 

### What gets me out of bed in the morning?
Food.
There are just so many delicious things that I have not tried yet out there and I'm on a quest to try as many types of food as possible!

When I am not thinking about how to fill my stomach, I enjoy going to K-Pop dance classes to learn and  perform choreography with others who share the same passion!

In terms of interests in the tech space, I am very interested in what the NHSx are doing, a department with the sole aim to bring the power of techonology into healthcare through streamlining work processes to developing new techonologies such as using AI to aid in earlier cancer detection! 
Techforce 19 was an intiative funded by NHSx which challenged tech companies to create apps to help vulerable people isolated by COVID-19.
